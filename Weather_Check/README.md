# Weather Check

A Python-based weather application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that fetches and displays the current weather details of a specified city. The app uses the OpenWeather API to get real-time weather data and `tkinter` to display it in a simple and interactive interface.

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Displays weather information like temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
- Provides a simple and interactive GUI built with Pythonâ€™s `tkinter` library.
- User-friendly: Just input the name of a city and get the weather information instantly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests` - For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API.
  - `python-dotenv` - To manage the OpenWeather API key securely.
  - `tkinter` - For the graphical user interface (usually included in standard Python distributions).

### Key Improvements:
- More concise and user-friendly.
- Clearer installation instructions with step-by-step guidance.
- Mention of `tkinter` usage in a more accessible way.
- Simplified setup of the `.env` file and API key.
- A more approachable tone with a focus on clarity.
